# AutoModerator

Project objectives:

1. Scrape annotations, submission comments and rubric assessment from submissions for a single Canvas assignment
2. Produce a moderation report that contains the following:
  - Average marks and distribution
  - Identification of submissions with incomplete rubrics
  - Identification if submissions with "insufficient"* feedback (annotations/comments)
  - Identification of markers with means that are significantly different from overall average*

*How should I define this?
